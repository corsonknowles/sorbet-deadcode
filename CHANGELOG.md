# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added (issue #10 — dynamic dispatch refinements)
- **Fix 1 — interpolation prefix via local variable**: `m = "dump_#{x}"; send(m)` now
  emits a `dump_` method-prefix reference instead of excluding the whole namespace.
- **Fix 2 — finite symbol-list iteration**: `[:a, :b].each { |m| send(m) }` and
  `METHODS.each { |m| send(m) }` (where `METHODS = [:a, :b].freeze`) now resolve to the
  exact method names rather than excluding the namespace.
- **Fix 3 — `dynamic_dispatch: :report` mode**: instead of excluding methods in a
  namespace with unresolvable variable dispatch, report them as `:low` confidence
  candidates for review (opt-in; default remains `:exclude`).
- **Fix 4 — LSP cross-check (validated, not adopted as default)**: investigated using the
  LSP pass to validate variable-dispatch candidates instead of excluding them. **Finding:
  Sorbet's `textDocument/references` is static and cannot resolve `__send__(variable)` /
  interpolated dispatch any better than Prism**, so dropping the conservative exclusion in
  hybrid mode would reintroduce the exact `MemberSerializer#dump_*` false positive. The
  `:exclude` default is therefore retained; fixes 1/2 shrink its blast radius and fix 3 is
  the explicit review escape hatch. See `test_report_mode_candidate_has_no_static_references`.

### Changed
- **`--verify` is now the default** — ripgrep verification runs automatically after every
  analysis pass. Use `--no-verify` to opt out. This eliminates the bulk of name-collision
  false positives with negligible overhead (~seconds on large repos).

### Added
- **Framework DSL plugins** (closes #3) — `delegate`, AASM events, and GraphQL mutations
  now emit method references so their callback targets and generated methods stay alive:
  - `delegate :foo, :bar, to: :target` keeps `foo` and `bar` alive
  - `delegate ... prefix: :scope` keeps `scope_foo` alive; `prefix: true` keeps `*_foo` variants alive
  - AASM `event :activate, after: [:notify], guard: :can_activate?` keeps all symbol callbacks alive
  - `error_on_all_events :handle_aasm_error` keeps the handler alive
  - GraphQL `builds :order` keeps `build_order` alive
  - GraphQL `argument :x, prepare: :load_x` and `field :x, method: :display` keep targets alive
- **Confidence tiers** (closes #5) — `SorbetDeadcode::Analyzer::Confidence.for(definition, ref_index)`
  returns `:high`, `:medium`, or `:low`; `--confidence` flag annotates CLI output with the tier
- **`Index` class + `--index` / `--report` / `--intersect` subcommands** (closes #9, #8):
  - `--index output.json` saves the full dead-code index for later querying
  - `--report index.json [paths...]` loads an index and filters to paths without re-analyzing
  - `--intersect other.json` narrows results to candidates appearing in both indexes (enables
    Spoom cross-comparison workflow)
  - `Index#filter_paths`, `Index#for_paths`, `Index#intersect` available as a Ruby API
- **Performance regression guard** (closes #6) — two benchmark specs ensure the liveness
  analysis stays O(N) on a 1000-definition synthetic codebase (< 5s threshold)

## Previously released (main)

### Added
- **Interpolated dynamic dispatch detector** — `public_send("dump_#{type}")` keeps all `dump_*` methods alive; `__send__(method_name)` (variable target) keeps every method in the enclosing namespace alive
- **Inline constant nesting detector** — `PARENT = [CHILD_A = 1, CHILD_B = 2]` never reports `PARENT` dead while a child constant is still referenced
- **`--reference-root DIR`** — scan a broader directory for references without collecting definitions from it; prevents public API methods from appearing dead when callers live outside the analyzed paths
- **Rails callback DSL** — `validate :method`, `before_save :hook`, `after_commit :flush`, and 16 other lifecycle hooks now emit method references so callback targets stay alive
- **`accepts_nested_attributes_for`** — emits a method-prefix reference so `_attributes=` overrides are kept alive
- **Mailer preview detection** — classes inheriting from `ActionMailer::Preview` or named `*MailerPreview` are marked dynamically dispatched (invoked by the Rails preview router)
- **`Prism::Visitor` protocol** — classes inheriting from a `*Visitor` base emit a `visit_` prefix reference, keeping all `visit_*` methods alive
- **`ALWAYS_ALIVE_METHODS`** — `initialize`, `respond_to_missing?`, `method_missing`, `use_relative_model_naming?`, `to_s`, `inspect` are never reported dead
- **Multi-file namespace deduplication** — a module opened in 2+ files is treated as a shared namespace and never reported dead
- **Constant-path prefix tracking** — `A::B::C` now emits references for `A`, `A::B`, and `A::B::C`, keeping ancestor modules alive
- **SimpleCov** — 100% line and branch coverage enforced on every commit
- **`name_alive?` mixed-evidence fix** — when both typed and untyped references exist for a name, untyped references are no longer suppressed

### Fixed
- **Ripgrep verifier `?`/`!` bug** — method names ending in `?` or `!` were treated as regex quantifiers, causing every boolean predicate to appear dead regardless of actual usage. Fixed by adding `-F` (fixed-strings) to the `rg` command
- **`close_streams` extracted from `shutdown`** for testability; removed structurally-dead `return nil unless content_length` guard in `read_message`
- **`visit_def_node` param cleanup** — param types were erroneously cleared for the wrong method name after a nested def

### Internal
- `ALWAYS_ALIVE_METHODS` constant replaces scattered individual checks
- `compute_multi_file_namespaces` pre-indexes at run time rather than per-check
- `dynamically_dispatched?` unified for both method-prefix and namespace-level exclusions
